# PenguinSupermarket, code about penguins in the market.
```
Costumers can add product into their basket. Then they will enter the queue of any register(checkout), 
also they are able to know chekouts with the lowest queue.After that, they wait their time to place all
their products on the belt at the checkout and pick them up after they pay (if they can).

It is noteworthy that, there are several checkouts and any of them may be closed at any time, thus customer
penguins have to move to another checkout.
```
For this task I used Stack, Queue, generic types, classes and interfaces.
